The goal of this game is to find the exit or winning room but even then you need to "activate" the exit.
You can explore different rooms and find weapons to fight enemies.
If you successfully kill an enemy you heal.
You can't leave a room with an enemy.
If you fight an enemy without a weapon you instantly die.
There is one trap room that instantly kills you.
